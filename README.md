The program is similar to the Mega-Sena® betting system, it is written in Java and operates in 4 phases: betting phase, drawing phase, evaluation phase, and award phase.

## Prerequisites 🔧

To run the project, you need to have an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and Java installed and configured on your machine.

The project was built using version 19.0.2 of the Java SE Development Kit from Oracle.

It's worth noting that this project was developed and tested on the Windows operating system.

If you don't have Java installed, please visit the Oracle website for installation:
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk19-archive-downloads.html

If you don't have an IDE, you can choose one according to your preference, but I recommend one of these two:
- IntelliJ: https://www.jetbrains.com/pt-br/idea/download/?section=windows
- VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

### Operation⚙️

Betting phase:

    1- Start by registering bets, providing full name and CPF (Brazilian Individual Taxpayer Registry) number (only numbers). 

    2- After that, choose whether you want to register your bet manually or if you want the system to generate it automatically for you (Quick Pick).
		- Manual: with software guidance, you will input one number at a time.
		- Automatic: all 5 numbers will be generated at once.

    3- Repeat the previous steps for as many bets as you want to make.

Drawing phase:

    4- Here you have the option to view the bets or to proceed with the drawing, where 5 random numbers between 1 and 50 will be drawn.

Fase de apuração:

    5- If there is one or more winners right away, we proceed to step 7.

    6- If there are no winners, up to 25 rounds of drawing an extra winning number will be conducted to try to find one or more winners.
      - Only the quantity of winning numbers increases; if within this array we have 5 numbers matching yours, you win!

    7- If we have winners, after the evaluation, the first thing displayed is the list organized in alphabetical order.

    8- Regardless of whether we have winners or not, a list of the numbers bet and how many times each was bet is displayed.

Award phase:

    9- If there are winners, the prize is announced; otherwise, the program ends with a message stating that there were no winners.

### Award 🎁

The prize for the bet could be something simple, like just money or a simple trip to Noronha. But it's not.

In ULOTTERY, in addition to the U$300,000.00 that will be divided among the winners (or not, if we have someone very lucky), there will be the delivery of Dell product kits (a imaginary sponsor).

- If there is only one winner, they will receive nothing less than the super Dell kit, consisting of an incredible Dell G15 laptop with an NVIDIA 4050, a wireless/bluetooth Dell mouse and keyboard set (KB700), the excellent Dell Gaming 17 backpack, and finally, a mega-paid trip for you and a companion to visit Dell headquarters in Round Rock, Texas, United States.


- If there are up to 3 winners, the kit changes. It will be the most versatile day-to-day notebook on the market, the Inspiron 15 with 8GB DDR4, the wonderful Alienware AW520H headset (white or black), and the famous Dell EcoLoop Essential 14-16 backpack.


- If there are 4 or more winners, the lucky ones will receive it, the Dell EcoLoop Essential 14-16" backpack, the "life-saving" Dell DA310 USB-C 7-in-1 multi-port dockstation, and the classic Dell wireless mouse.
